Events on line :date:
=======
A software development collective wants to create a web application to manage their online events such as workshops, masterclass or webinars.

Users will be able to see the description of an event, sign up and unsubscribe. 

They will be able to see the list of the events they have signed up for. 

The administrator must have the tools for the management (CRUD) of the events.

# Functionalities :floppy_disk:

The application will have a slider with the highlighted masterclasses. These will be selectable by the administrator.

Events shall include at least: title, date/time, maximum number of participants, description and an image.

Users must register to sign up for an event.

Users will be able to see on one page the list of events to which they are registered.

The administrator will be able to CRUD the events.

Cuando un evento esté lleno (máximo número de participantes) nadie podrá registrarse.
